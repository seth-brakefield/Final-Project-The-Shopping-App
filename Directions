Problem Description:
We need an app that will be able to illustrate collecting data for inventory and showing purchases of that inventory.
Start with a menu system that will allow the user to choose between functionality. 
•	Show a list of products (inventory)
•	Add inventory (price, description, who is selling)
•	Delete inventory
•	Purchase a product for a user (removing it from inventory)
•	Show a list of products sold including their purchaser
•	Make sure to have dates on all activity

Put a plan together and type out how you will build this app in the analysis section.

Type the UML diagram for the classes in the design portion. Feel free to add any other fields that you would like to share.

 
Guidelines:
•	Use your own creative liberties and make it fun
•	No more than a team of 5
•	You will present this to the class at the end of the semester; feel free to choose a speaker for the team.
  Make it professional and have a working version of code that you can present. Be ready to answer questions about the code.
  Presentation should be between 5 and 10 minutes including introductions.
•	Code should be zipped and uploaded to blackboard individually. You will grade your teammates with reasoning for the grade.
